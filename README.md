These are demo scripts to learn how to work with lab infrastructure and data. 

Start with `plab_data_demo`, then move on to demos relevant to your project. If directions are unclear, ask Andy - these demos are a work in progress.

When you finish a section or demo, go over the code with Andy.

Do as much as you can yourself - if you're stuck, first try Googling an answer to your question (which is the most important coding skill), and if that doesn't work then ask Andy/a lab member for help.
